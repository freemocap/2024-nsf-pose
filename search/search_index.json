Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms, that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.</p> <p>POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps\u2122), Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) and Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR and STTR) represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway \u2013 supporting the transition from open-source research artifacts to OSEs.</p> <p>Importantly, the POSE program is not intended to fund the development of open-source products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is also not intended to fund existing well-resourced, open-source communities or ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to support new managing organizations to catalyze distributed, community-driven development and growth of new OSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are to grow the community of researchers and innovators who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and to enable pathways for the safe and secure development of OSEs that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can stem from any areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and development.</p> <p>This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to propose specific activities to scope and plan the establishment of an OSE (Phase I), and to establish a sustainable OSE based on a robust open-source product that shows promise in the ability to both meet an emergent societal or national need and build a community to help develop it (Phase II).</p> <p>Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Proposals</p> <p>Phase I projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users though the product may not necessarily have external content developers. The objectives of Phase I projects are to: (1) enable scoping activities that will inform the transition of promising research products that are already available in open-source formats into sustainable and robust OSEs that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE.</p> <p>Each Phase I proposal must describe the current context and, to the extent known at the time of the Phase I proposal, the long-term vision and potential impact of the proposed OSE. The proposals should also include specific scoping activities that will inform plans for ecosystem discovery; organizational and governance structure; continuous development, integration, and deployment of the open-source product(s); and community building for users and intellectual content developers. Phase I scoping activities are intended to help teams determine (a) whether their open-source product is suitable and ready to be transitioned into an OSE; (b) whether there is a user base that is ready to serve as early adopters; and (c) whether there is a distributed intellectual content developer community that can help develop and maintain the core product going forward.</p> <p>Phase I proposals are limited to a total budget of $300,000 with durations of up to one year. The Project Description can be up to 7 pages for Phase I proposals.</p> <p>Please note that the Phase I proposals described in this solicitation are a solicitation-specific project category and are separate and distinct from the Planning type of proposal described in Chapter II.F.1 of the PAPPG. When preparing a Phase I proposal in response to this solicitation, the \"Research\" type of proposal should be selected.</p> <p>Phase II: Establishment and Expansion Proposals</p> <p>Phase II projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users and external content developers. The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposals are expected to have conducted the scoping activities (not necessarily via a Phase I award) needed to develop a detailed project plan to support the community-driven distributed development and deployment of successful open-source tools into operational environments. The proposals must include a community outreach plan that outlines activities to engage the intended intellectual content developer community that will further develop and maintain the technology and identifies user communities and/or organizations that will serve as early adopters of the technology.</p> <p>Each Phase II proposal must describe the current context and the long-term vision and impact of the proposed OSE. The proposal should also include a well-developed, cohesive plan for building an OSE, including ecosystem establishment/growth, organizational and governance structure, a framework for continuous development, integration, and deployment of the technology, methods for evaluating the OSE's effectiveness, and activities to ensure security and privacy, build the community, and sustain the ecosystem.</p> <p>Phase II proposals are limited to a total budget of $1,500,000 with durations of up to two years. The Project Description can be up to 15 pages for Phase II proposals.</p> <p>Phase I awardees are not obligated to submit Phase II proposals in the future.</p> <p>An NSF POSE Phase I award is not required for the submission of a Phase II proposal.</p> <p>Cognizant Program Officer(s):</p> <p>Please note that the following information is current at the time of publishing.

Introduction","text":"<p>The term \"open-source\" has often referred to software systems for which the original source code is widely distributed to anyone and for any purpose, including for further development and refinement in a collaborative public manner. However, increasingly, \"open-source\" refers to a much broader range of products such as programming languages or formats; hardware instruction sets; designs or specifications; scientific methodologies, models, or processes; manufacturing processes or process specifications; material formulations; and data platforms.</p> <p>Academic and industrial researchers worldwide are extensively using the open-source model to make research artifacts such as software, tools, and prototypes openly available with a goal of enabling collaboration and catalyzing further innovation. An open-source product can be shared via a webpage on the Internet, but a more common approach uses a version control system. Multiple NSF research infrastructure programs support further development of open-source projects with the goal of serving the research community and enabling advances in science and engineering research and education, including the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Community Research Infrastructure (CCRI), Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI), Infrastructure Capacity for Biological Research (Capacity), and Human Networks and Data Science \u2013 Infrastructure (HNDS-I).</p> <p>Some open-source projects go well beyond their original research teams, catalyzing broad adoption across academia, industry, government, and other sectors, and resulting in communities of users and intellectual content developers who coalesce around them into \"ecosystems\". Examples of NSF-funded open-source research projects and products that have transitioned into OSEs with broad measurable and transformative impact include: LLVM, a modular and reusable compiler infrastructure to construct, optimize and produce intermediate and/or binary machine code that has seen wide adoption in industry; Galaxy, a scientific workflow, data integration / analysis, and publishing platform that makes computational biology accessible to researchers who do not have computer programming or systems administration experience; and RISC-V, an open, standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that enables researchers, developers, and manufacturers to design and experiment with building hardware with a proven and freely available ISA. There are many such open-source projects in all areas of science that have benefited from open collaboration and innovation.</p> <p>An Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) is a self-sustaining organization that enables the ongoing, distributed, asynchronous development of an open-source product that is designed to be publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable by anyone under an open-source licensing model. An OSE organization has several key components: a leadership team that is responsible for governance and management of distributed development processes and infrastructure, a decentralized and open network of intellectual content developers who are committed to the vision of the OSE and contribute their time and expertise to develop and maintain the core product, and users whose needs serve to guide the evolution of the product. The intellectual content developers are a key part of an OSE since they help develop, grow, and maintain the core open-source product. Building a successful open-source community depends on many different elements, including recruitment, motivation, mentoring, managing, and mediating disputes among community members, and all without compensation to reward and provide incentives to contributors. There are many existing models of OSEs, ranging from non-profit institutions that are well-coordinated community efforts to build and support open source products (e.g., the Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation, and the Mozilla Foundation), to for-profit companies that release open-source products and then coordinate an open-source community around them (e.g., IBM's Qiskit and Google's TensorFlow).</p> <p>OSEs are an important alternative to more common for-profit technology companies and offer several key strengths: they are well suited to multidisciplinary efforts aimed at solving large-scale problems; they engender a sense of ownership among all participants and encourage contributions from new technical disciplines as the OSE evolves; and they avoid costs, delays, and disputes that frequently arise in circumstances where proprietary solutions are developed. OSEs encourage rapid prototyping in moving value from the conception to execution phases, serving as important catalysts for innovation.</p> <p>A key aspect of successful OSEs is their value in demonstrating the potential of a technology at scale in diverse application scenarios. While not always easy to quantify, the significant technological, societal, and economic impacts of OSEs over the past decades are undeniable. For example, a recent European Commission study estimated that companies located in the European Union invested around 1 billion Euros in open-source software alone in 2018, which brought about a positive impact on the European economy of between 65 and 95 billion Euros.</p>"},{"location":"notes/funding-opportunity-announcement-foa/2024_NSF_POSE_foa_nsf23556/#ii-program-description","title":"II. Program Description","text":"<p>The purpose of the POSE program is to support a new pathway for translating research or innovation results by supporting managing organizations that facilitate the creation and growth of sustainable, high-impact OSEs around already-developed open-source products, tools, and artifacts. The POSE program aims to grow the community of researchers who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and enable pathways to intentionally transition promising, robust open-source innovations into self-sustaining OSEs that could lead to new technology products or services with broad societal impacts.</p> <p>Importantly, the POSE program does not itself support further development of open-source research products or infrastructure. A key attribute of OSEs is a distributed development model in which external intellectual content developers use a continuous development, integration, and deployment model to develop and/or maintain the core open-source product. Projects lacking this distributed development aspect are not well suited for POSE and may be better suited for infrastructure programs. For example, a data repository with a centralized development model where external content developers only upload data without supporting intellectual content would not be suitable for POSE. Likewise, the POSE program is not intended for open-source development, robustness efforts, or focused communities with limited impact. Instead, POSE proposals are expected to build on an existing, robust, open-source product that has active users outside of the founding team. For example, open-source software specific to the advanced cyberinfrastructure of a particular scientific community may be better served as a submission to the \"Transition to Sustainability\" track in the NSF CSSI program. Finally, POSE is also not intended to support the development of products that are intended for profit; Such efforts may be better suited for NSF's Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR / STTR) programs.</p> <p>The transition from open-source research or innovation project to an OSE requires an organized and intentional approach that depends on many factors. These include: (1) the guiding principles and vision of the founding team, (2) the specific open-source product being developed, (3) the demand for this product within the current technological landscape, (4) the need for adaptability and flexibility in deployment scenarios, (5) a distributed community of intellectual content developers who will drive the collaborative development of the technology, and (6) a community of users who will serve as early adopters of the technology. OSEs are frequently supported by an international community of users and developers from different sectors, including academia, non-profit, and industry. POSE strongly encourages proposers to consider mechanisms to intentionally involve all these groups, including international collaborators.</p> <p>As shown in Figure 1, the transition from open-source product to OSE can be thought of as a continuum. At one end of this continuum is an early stage open-source artifact that, for example, may have been developed by a scientist for a specific use and has been adopted by a small number of users. At the other end is a fully developed OSE based on a robust open-source artifact, managed by an organization that: coordinates an external distributed developer community; interfaces with and supports a community of users; provides training and onboarding to new developers and users; enables efficient continuous development, integration and deployment of the open-source product; maintains an efficient supply chain; ensures security, privacy and reliability of all aspects of the OSE operations; and maintains appropriate organizational governance practices. POSE aims to support this transition, assisting the evolution of an early stage open-source project to a fully operational OSE that is capable of realizing the potential societal impact nascent in the originating open-source artifact.</p> <p> Figure 1. Transition from Open-source Product to Open-source Ecosystem</p> <p>This solicitation seeks two types of proposals: first to scope and plan for an OSE (Phase I), and second to establish and expand (Phase II) a sustainable OSE based on an existing and robust open-source product that shows promise both in the ability to meet an emergent societal or national need and to build a community to help develop it. Importantly, the open-source product should already (i) be publicly accessible, preferably via an open-source license (proposers are encouraged to consider licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative) and (ii) have some external third-party users and/or external intellectual content developers. In this context the term \"external\" means external to the founding team.</p> <p>An OSE supported by POSE, as shown in Figure 2, will comprise three components: a distributed community of intellectual content developers from academia, industry and/or the non-profit sector; a community of third-party end users in research, industry, government, and/or other sectors \u2013 some of whom may also be intellectual content developers; and a managing organization. POSE funding will support the managing organization, the role of which includes all of the functions described above and whose overarching objective is to ensure sustainability of the OSE. The primary distinction between Phase I and Phase II is that Phase I scoping and planning projects are intended for organizations that are less experienced or knowledgeable in building a distributed intellectual content developer or end user communities, and/or would benefit from learning more about the non-technical roles of a POSE managing organization \u2013 e.g., corporate governance, legal and administrative functions, licensing, etc.</p> <p> Figure 2. Role of the POSE Managing Organization</p> <p>A maximum of three members of each awarded team are expected to attend a mandatory OSE training to be held virtually in 2023 and 2024. Training will enable each awarded team to determine whether there is the potential for a relevant and sustainable OSE for their open-source product, learn best-practices for building a secure, private, and sustainable OSE, and identify broad societal impacts for their OSE. The program will include experiential learning activities in ecosystem discovery and workshop sessions focused on community building, governance, and sustainability of OSEs. For planning purposes, NSF anticipates this training will require a time commitment on the order of 8 hours a week for four weeks. NSF will provide further details (e.g., logistics) about this training to all awardees.</p> <p>In addition to requirements specified in the PAPPG, including a separate section labeled \"Broader Impacts\", both Phase I and Phase II proposals must have a separate section titled \"Context of OSE\" describing the context and vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of the guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, the specific societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, and the anticipated broader impacts of the OSE. Proposals must also have (1) a pointer to the existing publicly-available open-source product that is being transitioned; (2) details on the current status of the open-source product, development model, methods of dissemination, and user base; (3) a description of the problem being addressed, and the novelty of the intended product being transitioned, including substantiating evidence of the technology's potential to significantly impact/address the problem; and (4) a strong justification that makes the case that the team is qualified to conduct this work.</p> <p>All proposals must include a security plan that addresses all project-relevant security aspects, particularly those related to the open-source products, such as data and source code including data privacy and code quality. Proposers are encouraged to consider the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) guidance for developers on securing software supply chains and the Open Source Security Foundation's best practices. This security plan should be part of the \"Data Management Plan\" (see Proposal Preparation Instructions for additional details).</p> <p>See Section V. for further details and other additional requirements. Proposals that do not meet these requirements will be returned without review.</p> <p>Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Awards</p> <p>Phase I awards are not intended to support further development efforts since the open-source products are expected to be robust tools with active user bases. Rather, Phase I awards will support OSE scoping and planning activities that will inform the development of Phase II proposals. Phase I proposals are limited to $300,000 in total budget, with durations of up to one year. The Project Description can be up to 7 pages. Please note that the Phase I proposals described in this solicitation are a solicitation-specific project category and are separate and distinct from the Planning type of proposal described in Chapter II.F.1 of the PAPPG. When preparing a Phase I proposal in response to this solicitation the \"Research\" type of proposal should be selected.</p> <p>Phase I proposals should address the following:</p> <ul> <li>Ecosystem Discovery: Include a plan for developing a strategy that: (1) describes methods to evaluate and justify the need for the innovation within the current technological landscape; (2) explains why an OSE is the right approach to further develop the technology; and (3) outlines methods to identify potential users who will utilize this technology.</li> <li>Organization and Governance: Describe specific activities and their rationale that will identify: (1) the appropriate organizational, coordination, and governance models including the licensing approach to be employed; (2) the specific continuous development and integration processes and infrastructure that is most suitable for open, asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product, (3) processes for ensuring quality, security, privacy or ethical concerns of new content; and (4) the best methods for sustaining the organizational structure, including metrics to assess and evaluate long-term success of the development methodology, support for users, and on-boarding mechanisms for new contributors.</li> <li>Community Building: Describe the specific activities to engage potential users and intellectual content developers, including: (1) identification of the specific research and development capabilities required of the potential contributor communities; and (2) mechanisms to engage these communities (e.g., workshops, hackathons, competitions, research coordination networks, and Ideas Labs).</li> </ul> <p>Phase II: OSE Establishment and Expansion Awards</p> <p>The objective of Phase II awards is to support the establishment of a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposals are limited to $1,500,000 in total budget, with durations of up to two years. The Project Description can be up to 15 pages.</p> <p>Phase II proposals should include the following components:</p> <ul> <li>Ecosystem Establishment/Growth: Include a well-developed ecosystem establishment and ongoing discovery strategy to ensure that the proposed OSE can effectively grow the open-source product within the current technological landscape, along with specific plans to identify, engage, and support potential users and partners who will serve as early adopters for the product. The inclusion of specific plans to engage industrial and international collaborators are also encouraged.</li> <li>Organization and Governance: Describe a well-developed and sustainable organizational, coordination, and governance model including the licensing approach to be employed.</li> <li>Continuous Development Model: Describe the specific continuous development, integration, and deployment methodology and infrastructure that will be employed to enable the open, asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product and specific processes for ensuring quality control, security, and privacy of new content.</li> <li>Community Building: Describe a long-term strategy for community building to engage, incentivize, on-board, and support potential users and content developers who will help in further developing and maintaining the open-source product.</li> <li>Sustainability: Articulate clear sustainability goals of the OSE and an actionable evaluation plan, along with metrics to assess and evaluate success.</li> </ul> <p>General Considerations</p> <p>The POSE program seeks broad and diverse representation of PIs and organizations in its award portfolio, reflective of the Nation's demography and geography.</p> <p>Ethical use of data, including the privacy and protection of human subjects, is of paramount importance. If the proposed project will involve the use of human data or data related to human activities, PIs should consult with their organization's Institutional Review Board (IRB) to obtain either IRB approval or official letters of exemption. Proposals will not be recommended for award until and unless appropriate IRB approval or exemption documents have been submitted to NSF. See PAPPG Chapter II.D.5 for NSF policies on proposals involving human subjects.</p> <p>For proposals involving the use of vertebrate animals, sufficient information must be provided in the project description to enable reviewers to evaluate the choice of species, number of animals to be used, and any necessary exposure of animals to discomfort, pain, or injury. NSF requires that proposed projects involving use of any vertebrate animal for research or education be approved by the submitting organization's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) before an award can be made.

If a trust owns all or part of the organization, each trustee and trust beneficiary is considered an owner.</p> <p>The above ownership requirement states that at least a majority of a proposing organization's equity must be held by certain types of eligible entities (individuals and/or other firms). Therefore, when determining your organization's eligibility, you must be able to identify an ownership majority (of individuals and/or entities) that is made up of eligible individuals and/or other firms.</p> <p>Each individual included as part of the eligible ownership majority of a proposing organization must be either a citizen or permanent resident alien of the US.

NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures","text":"<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p> <p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.</p> <p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.</p> <p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.</p> <p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>"},{"location":"notes/funding-opportunity-announcement-foa/2024_NSF_POSE_foa_nsf23556/#a-merit-review-principles-and-criteria","title":"A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria","text":"<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p> <p>1. Merit Review Principles</p> <p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:</p> <ul> <li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li> <li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These \"Broader Impacts\" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li> <li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li> </ul> <p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.</p> <p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.</p> <p>2. Merit Review Criteria</p> <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p> <p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. Both criteria are to be given full consideration during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.</p> <p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li> <li>Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li> </ul> <p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p> <ol> <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to</li> <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li> <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li> <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li> <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li> <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li> <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li> </ol> <p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p> <p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.</p> <p>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</p> <p>Phase I proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the following solicitation-specific review criteria:</p> <ol> <li>Does the proposal present a convincing case that the OSE will address an issue of significant societal or national importance that is not currently being adequately addressed?</li> <li>Does the proposal clearly describe the long-term vision for the OSE, including potential partnerships and sustainability?</li> <li>Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that a substantial user base exists, or could be built, for the open-source product that will be the subject of the OSE?</li> <li>Does the proposal justify the OSE within the current technological landscape and present a strong case that an OSE is the best approach for generating impact?</li> <li>Does the proposal present clear plans for discovering the ecosystem within which the OSE will be operating?</li> <li>Does the proposal present a credible plan for exploring the establishment of a sustainable organizational structure?</li> <li>Does the proposal present a credible plan to develop a strategy for building a community of contributors?</li> <li>Does the proposing team have the required expertise and experience to undertake the Phase I activities described in the solicitation?</li> <li>Will NSF support serve as a critical catalyst for the establishment of the OSE?</li> <li>Does the proposal include third-party letters of collaboration from current users of the open-source product that is the subject of the OSE?</li> </ol> <p>Phase II proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the following solicitation-specific review criteria:</p> <ol> <li>Does the proposal present a convincing case that the OSE will address an issue of significant societal or national importance that is not currently being adequately addressed?</li> <li>Does the proposal clearly describe the long-term vision for the OSE, including potential partnerships and sustainability?</li> <li>Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that a substantial user base exists for the open-source product that will be the subject of the OSE?</li> <li>Does the proposal justify the OSE within the current technological landscape and present a strong case that an OSE is the best approach for generating impact?</li> <li>Does the proposal present a clear and comprehensive description of the ecosystem within which the OSE will be operating along with plans for ongoing ecosystem establishment/growth and discovery?</li> <li>Does the proposal present a specific, actionable plan for establishing a sustainable organizational structure?</li> <li>Does the proposal present a credible strategy and actionable plan for building a community of contributors and retaining contributors?</li> <li>Does the proposal include a clear, detailed licensing approach for the open-source product that is the subject of the OSE?</li> <li>Does the proposal clearly describe a build and test infrastructure, and procedures to address quality control and security of new content?</li> <li>Does the proposal present a clear, actionable evaluation plan to measure the success of the OSE with respect to its sustainability goals?</li> <li>Does the proposing team have the required expertise and experience to undertake the Phase II activities described in the solicitation?</li> <li>Will NSF support serve as a critical catalyst for the establishment and growth of the OSE towards achieving sustainability?</li> <li>Does the proposal include third-party letters of collaboration from current users of the open-source technology that is the subject of the OSE?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"notes/funding-opportunity-announcement-foa/2024_NSF_POSE_foa_nsf23556/#b-review-and-selection-process","title":"B.

The Act states the purpose of the NSF is \"to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering.\"</p> <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p> <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p> <p>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide Chapter II.F.7 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p> <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information.
