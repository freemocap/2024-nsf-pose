# *POSE: PHASE II: The Free Motion Capture (FreeMoCap) Project*

## Introduction
Gap/Need/Hero statements

### Intellectual Merit
How we will advance knowledge

### Broader Impact
How we will help the world

### Context of the OSE
#### Context
- The problem of universities
  - Exclusionary by design
  - Ever hungry corporate engine that driven by student debt
    - Tuition room and board
    - Overhead charges
  - 'Education as a filter' \cite{arrow1970}
    - Need for expansive training methods
  - The 'banking model'
- 'The open source community *is* what the scientific community pretends to be'
  - The problem of cottage industries
  - The problem of publication (cite that guy's blog)
  - The story of Grease Pencil
#### Vision
- Guiding Principles and Long Term Vision for the OSE
  - Universal Design
  - Knowledge is Free
  - No artificial scarcity
- Societal or National Need for the OSE
  - Current model not fit for present and future needs
  - Need alternative models, organizations, infrastructures for science and education
    - Generative and self sustaining
      - Von Neumann machine - Sustainibility through replicability 
  - Two Loops theory of social progress
- Anticipated Broader Impacts of the OSE

## Long Term Vision for
Describe the Ideal Perfect Future vision of... 

### The FreeMoCap Project (FMC-P)
  (include tables crossing each list with `current`, `in development`, `planned`)
  - Infrastructure Table:
      - Technical Capacities 
      - Infrastructure
      - Tools and Frameworks
      - Documentation and covert education
  
### The FreeMoCap Community (FMC-C)
  - Broad and deep user base, integrating (<3d space):
    - User/Developers
    - Scientist/Artists
    - Student/Expert
    - Any definable vector 
      - `Mentorship` vector
        - Defined as another user's UserStateVector (USV)
      - `Community` vector
        - Defined as median USV of users within a given community (with XP level > `threshold`)
  - Nurture long term user support, measured (consentually) via interactions with software and community spaces
    - Model as a trajectory though the 3d space defined above
      - User state on each level: 
        - Proficiency
        - Interest
        - Experience
      - Mis-matches define 'gentle pressure' vectors
      - PID controller with stochastic noise encouraging exploration into 'zones of proximal development' (ZoPD)
    - Active social community space where users can share progress and ask questions
    - Simulacrum support - AI assistant (SkellyBot)
      - AI modeled to provide a SIMULATION of real human support 
      - Explicitly AI at all times, intended to provide infinitely duplicable simulation of replicable text based emotional labor
      - ReadTheManualBot (RTFM-bot)
        - Goals:
          - Primary: Help them learn and run the software
          - Secondary: Avoid 'paradox of active user' (offer quicker paths to victory)
        - RAG model
          - Docs (FreeMoCap Technical Docs)
          - Logs (User current and past logs, Github Issues, Server `Help Requests` channel)
          - Images (e.g. from cameras, videos, or screenshots)
          - Data (`npy`, `csv`, `sql`, `json`, with helper readers)
      - WouldYouLikeToKnowMoreBot (WYLTKM-Bot)
        - RAG model
          - Docs (FreeMoCap Educational Docs, blog, YT transcripts, Server chat records)
          - Wikipedia
          - Search Engine Request (SerPAPI)

### The FreeMoCap Foundation (FMC-F)
  - 501c3
  - Indpendently support FreeMoCap Project/Community
  - Handle security, privacy of data, codebase,  and user info
  - Paying a core set of maintainer/developers
  - Revenue streams
    - For Profit sub-entitie(s) 
      - `Skellytech`
        - B2B connections and sub-licensing of:
          - Core-software 
          - Derivative models (co-op data ownership)
        - Any arrangement that does not fall under the 'charitable activities' allowed by 501c3 guidelines
      - Spin-off companies (FreeMoCap as tech incubator)
        - Incubator support for FMCF member/students who want to start businesses or organizations based on freemocap related technology and tools
        - Offer umbrella support (we support them with our org infrastructure, e.g. grant support), or
        - Launchpad support (pathway to independence)
        - Offer exit (any time) and re-entry (if possoible) mechanisms
    - Manage grants, both for org (e.g. NSF POSE) and individual research grants for members of FMCF (e.g. R01's and F32's)
    - Selling hardware/cameras
      - first, dropship standard cameras and packages (low-to-high quality)
      - later, develop custom cameras (including education focused cameras)
    - Donation drives 
    - Clients (Contracting from FMC community)
      - Custom code/software
      - Project planning and consultation 
      - Technical support
      - Direct teaching/training
    - Annual Workshop (FreeMoCamp)
    - Annual Conference (FreeMoCon)
    - Server-side processing
    - Cloud data storage
