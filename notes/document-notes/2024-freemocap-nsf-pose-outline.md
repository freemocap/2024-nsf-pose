## Broader Impacts
How we will help the world

## Context of the OSE
### Current Context
#### Technogical context
  - Capacities
    - Cutting Edge (Established methods)
    - Bleeding Edge (Promising advances)
    - Likely futures 
  - Related projects
    - Michael Black 
    - R. James Cotton 
    - MMPose

    - Growing Gaps 
      - (See NSF Strategic plans)
##### The problem of universities
- Exclusionary by design
- Ever hungry corporate engine that driven by student debt
  - Tuition room and board
  - Overhead charges
- 'Education as a filter' \cite{arrow1970}
  - Need for expansive training methods
- The 'banking model' of education
  - Paolo friere
##### The problem of cottage industries
- Current system does not reward necessary activites to build and sustain an OSE
##### The problem of publication (cite that guy's blog)
- The story of Grease Pencil

### Need and Gap
  - Current model not fit for present and future needs
  - Need alternative models, organizations, infrastructures for science and education
    - Generative and self sustaining
      - Von Neumann machine - Sustainibility through replicability 
  - Two Loops theory of social progress
    - Not saying we should burn it all to the ground
    - It's already burning
    - We need to build a better ship
      - & f-ing ASAP plz thx
## Objectives and Long term vision
- Make FreeMoCap the best mocap option available
- Maximize accessibility
- Build vibrant community of user/developers
- Develop implicit educational methods
- The long term potential of a generative plan is difficult to constrain
  - **Meager success:**
    - New useful tool 
    - Small body of research
    - Education tools and strategy
  - **Expected outcomes:**
    -  Support and sustain the growing community of `freemocap` users, loosely organized around a shared love of the measurement, investigation, analysis, and expression of human and animal movement (broadly construed), comprising:
       -  **Researcher community**:  Researchers centered around integerated 'Laser Skeleton' research (Gestalt of vision + motor is greater than the sum of its parts), including sub-specialties of theory-driven and applied/clinical investigations
       -  **Developer community**:  Software developers and technologists edicated to the long term stability and development of the main artifactual vehicles of the FMC-OSE
       -  **User community** of technically and geographically diverse set of end user communities dedicated to the specialized domains and cross-disciplinary bridges asscociated with the broad domain of topics, fields, and methods associated with the FMC-P.
       -  Metrics - 
    - Sustainable organization and vibrant ecosystem existing as a proof-of-concept alternative organizational approach to broadscale academic research, education, and training
  - Idealist future: Iterative solutions on 'project-scale' strategy produces a vibrant ecosystem of ecosystem which fundamentally changes the face of education and scientific research.

## Guiding Principles 
### Universal Design
- "When anyone can use it, everyone benefits"
- Same tool for 0XP as for professional
- "The [aspirational goal] of creating a system that serves the needs of a professional research scientist while remaining intuitive to a 13-year-old with no technical training and no outside assistance"
- **Sustainability through accessibility**
  - The key to sustainability is a growing, active, diverse, and vibrant userbase
  - Universal design attracts the widest possible userbase

### Universal Access
- **Education focus**
  - to avoid [paradox of the active user]
  - foster **long term user relationships**
  - encourage community engagement
    - Push user-student into 'zone of proximal development'
    - Provide easy access to resources (AI, static, community)
  - (see **AI Simulacrum Mentorship**)
  - Covert education:
    - Using the thing should teach you how it works
    - ZoPD & WYLTKM-bot
- **Maintain a True Minimum**
  - **Hardware**
    - Understand and maintain an option to run with the barest, most generic, and lowest-possible cost hardware,
    - Focus and maintain a [generic hardware] pipeline as the core path
      - Specialized tools (e.g. sterocam, eye trackiner, emg, forceplates) and proprietary options (e.g. iPhone, Basler/FLIR cameras, etc) added via plug-in system
      - Developed by community and/or upon client request 
  - **Software**    
    - Maintain and understand requirements for different outcomes (specific to defined use cases)     
      - Minimal requirements (to get a viable output)
      - Recommended requirements
        - Default default (for first-timers)
        - Per use case
          - Max speed (e.g. real-time, long, high-res, high-fps recordings)
          - Max accuracy (e.g. scientists, clincians, artistic/atheltic performance)
      - Maximum requirements
        - Specs beyond which you won't see an improvement in results 
        - Determined by understand technical bottlenecks
    - (see **Evaluation/Diagnostics**)
  - **Cost**
    - Methods to avoid price-barrier for paid aspects of FMC-F Activities (see #no artificial scarcity, # revenue streams)
    - [HumbleBundleModel] - Sliding scale pay options 
      - Recommended cost relative to break-even.
      - Give user option to allocate overage to different programs/departments
        - (by necessity, the recommendations will be followed if at all possible, adjustments may be made to ensure long term stability of the FMC-Org.
        - Its kinda like a voting system, but with money)
        - Support for:
          - New features
          - Specific projects
          - Scholarship/community grants program
          - Unspecified
      - Users requesting at-or-below cost must submit a request, which can be evaluated and supported via the 'communal support' scholarship/money bucket [CommunityGrantSystem]

### No artificial scarcity
- **"Knowledge is free, labor is unbelievable expensive"**
- Anything that can be duplicated infinitely is free for everyone
  - Software
  - Documentation
  - Static documentation/tutorial/educational material, etc
- Anything that is finite (or costs us money) can be charged
  - Human labor
    - Service models
      - Setup/planning
      - Dedicated technical support
    - Custom Software
  - Server side processing
    - Mocap data
    - AI LLM
  - Cloud storage
  - Camera hardware
 
### Community Focus
 - Emphasize that the core of the FMC-P is the community of users
 - The software artifacts are the fruit of the garden
 - Develop lateral connections, encourage growth, exploration, community support 


### Aggressively open source
- **"The open source community *is* what the scientific community pretends to be"**
- FOSS as a matter of moral imperative centered on the premises of Univerisal Design and Universal Access
  - Identification of strategic advantage within the contexts of FOSS being the 'right thing to do'
  - See "why open source misses the point"
- Encourage conversations around moral and ethical contexts of current context of the project and society at large
- **Morality without Zealotry**
  - We have our conversations clearly, but do not exclude those who misalign provided they aren't operating in opposition to our values
  - More about being aware, explicit, and intentional around moral and ethical decisions
  - Encourage and allow non-FOSS aligned activities through the `For-Profit` entity via B2B connections with external and spin-off entitities
    - Charge according to degree of mis-alignment with core values

## Proposed actvitities
Activities to bring us from current status towards the Ideal Perfect status described above
### Ecosystem establishment and Growth
#### User Engagement/Education
- Model User as a dynamic trajectory though the >3d space with axes:
  - User vs Developer
  - Scientist vs Artist
  - Novice vs Expert
  - also - any definable vector 
    - `Mentorship` vector
      - Defined as another user's UserStateVector (USV)
    - `Community` vector
      - Defined as median USV of users within a given community (with XP level > `threshold`)
  - Use rigid milestones, stochastic user-matching, and AI-analysis to determine each users's 'Status' relative to each sub-topic, sub-skill, sub-community:
    - Proficiency [P]
    - Interest [I]
    - Experience [E]
  - Mis-matches between P, I define 'gentle pressure' vectors
  - Constant gentle pressure to increase `E` via:
    - Using more advanced methods
    - Gamifying improvement metric outputs (see `validation` and `diagnostics`)
    - Diving deeper into technical and scientific underpinnnings
  - PID controller with stochastic noise encouraging exploration into 'zones of proximal development' (ZoPD)

#### AI-mediated pseudo mentorship support (SkellyBot)
  - AI modeled to provide a SIMULATION of real human support 
  - Explicitly AI at all times, intended to provide infinitely duplicable simulation of replicable text based emotional labor
  - 100% transparancy to user re: 
    - Data available
    - Derived information (i.e. UserStatus)
    - Computations, processes, prompts, etc
  - Offer user direct control (i.e. they can explicity alter and edit their core data model to generate different support behavior from the AI)
    - e.g. let them directly tell the machine their interests, expertise, etc
  - SkellyBot sub-personas:
    - Onboarding-Bot
      - Goals:
        - Primary: Introduce new users to software
          - Onboarding tutorials
          - WYLTKM-bot
          - RTFM-bot
        - Secondary: Encourage engagement with community
          - Community Server spaces
          - Community Activitities
          - FreeMoCamp/Con
    - ReadTheManualBot (RTFM-bot)
      - Goals:
        - Primary: Help them learn and run the software
        - Secondary: Avoid 'paradox of active user' (offer quicker paths to victory)
      - RAG model
        - Docs (FreeMoCap Technical Docs)
        - Logs (User current and past logs, Github Issues, Server `Help Requests` channel)
        - Images (e.g. from cameras, videos, or screenshots)
        - Data (`npy`, `csv`, `sql`, `json`, with helper readers)
    - WouldYouLikeToKnowMoreBot (WYLTKM-Bot)
      - RAG model
        - Docs (FreeMoCap Educational Docs, blog, YT transcripts, Server chat records)
        - Wikipedia
        - Search Engine Request (SerPAPI)
         
#### Community Building
##### Annual Workshop/Conference: FreeMoCamp/Con 💀⛺
- FreeMoCamp: workshop/hackathon/training focus
- FreeMoCon: Confrence style, talks, showing off
- Inspirations:
  - Neuromatch (for virtual component)
  - Cold spring harbor (short term research project/workshop timeline)
  - Get an example of a hackathon from the Endurance crew
- In person & Virtual
  - Held at YMCA summer camp, or similar
    - All inclusive ticket - lodging and food handled by summer camp facilities
  - Online component via dedicated Element space (with Slack/Discord bridges)
  - ANYONE can view all online materials, and follow along activities (encouraging conversationin public server)
  - Paid online participants may engage directly in the dedicated event space, and will get direct engagement with folks at the in-person event (for troubleshooting/planning/etc)
  - Pricing
    - Corpo pricing ->  100% standard price (Set high enough to make the lowest pay tiers make sense)
    - Academic pricing -> 50% standard price
    - Community members (defined by badges and community participation) -> 25% Standard price
    - Additional **STEEP** discounts and scholarship programs for students, educators, researchers, artists, etc
      - Minimum price w/o scholarship = break-even price per participant
  - Combination hackathon, training workshop, and scientific conference on 'fully body movement research'
- Participants in teams
  - Plan and collect a data set
  - Analyze and present results
  - Encourage collaboration and data sharing between teams
  - Offer training/presentation 'tracks' for
    - Data collection
      - Understand and use the core software
    - Data analysis
      - Analyze and computationally model data
    - Data visualization (and animation/art)
      - Create visualizations and animations from freemocap data

##### Community Challenges

- Offer a prompt for a kind of movement/activity to record
  - Community works to record the best entry, submitted via Discord/Element/Freemocap.org
    - Community votes in 'Eurovision style'
      - i.e. each member has a fixed number of voting points to distribute among entries
      - Maybe **Badges** provide additional voting points?

##### Gamified documentation/software training

- Offer **Badges** and stuff in discord for milestones, i.e.
  - First contact - open the software
  - First record - Anything recorded
  - First success - Successful recording
  - e.g. also calibration, data analysis, PR, etc
- Apply badges in Discord/Element server (associated with a `freemocap.org` account?)
  - Badges offer ability to send 'top level' messages to otherwise view-only channels (i.e technical spaces)
    - Anyone can create a **thread** from a top-level message though
    - The idea would be to create spaces where higher XP folk can talk about complicated stuff without distraction [WorkingInPublic]
    - But also LowerXP folk can still see the conversations and ask questions (Maybe make it easy to summon SkellyBot to explain a message/conversation 🤔)

### Organization and Governance
- Build administrative infrastructure
- Developing SOPs
- Establish Core maintainer actvitites
- Develop `Skelly Enhancement Proposal` system

      - stability (unit tests)
      - security (e.g. dependabot),
      - replicability (e.g. test datasets)
  - Validation
    - Is the core tool providing accurate measurements of world?
    - External Validation
      - Against 'Gold Standard' marker-based mocap (e.g. Qualisys)
      - Ideally using standard mocap validation techniques from clinical biomechanics (ISB?)
    - Internal Validation 
      - Validation within a given dataset via error residuals,i.e. 
        - Reprojection error (2d tracker validation)
        - Rigid body correction residuals (3d data validation)
  - Diagnostics
    - Minimal requirements to maximize accessibility
      - Understanding and clearly defining 'minimum  specs' to achieve viable output
      - Strive to decrease these minimums while remining mindful of trade-offs
      - Minimum reqs also define max speed, relevant to realtime applications 
    - High-water marks and benchmarks
      - What is the best performance possible with unconstrained time and resources?
        - Speed (real-time processing)
          - FPS on standardized PCs at Min, Rec, Max setttings
        - Accuracy (scientific applications)
          - Validation score on Min, Rec, Max settings




### Sustainability 
#### Definitions, Strategies, Goals, and Metrics
#### **"Sustainability through replicability"**
  - Maintain organizational documents, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and eductional outreach to encourage others to create organizations with similar stucture to FMC-F
  - Good for other people from wildly different domains (not relevant to FMC-F mission)
  - Could spawn sub-orgs from with FMC-F (optionally existing within FMC-F umbrella, either as non-profit or for-profit org)
