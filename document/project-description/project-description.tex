\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro}}
 Context/Need/Gap/Hero Funnel. 
 sample citation: \cite{matthis_retinal_2022} 
%# Will probably need tightening and focusing on FMC/OSE

- Our current institutions of education and scientific research are inequitable, exclusionary by design, and ill-equipped to address the existential threats and transformative opportunities presented by the rise and spread of high technology through a globally interconnected world. 

- The current system is a built around a massive concentration of resources within Ivory-tower institutions, with research occuring in siloed 'cottage industries' driven by student labor and debt within a gerontocratic ponzi-scheme competition based heirarchy predicated on the assumption of lateral competition predicated on assumptions of false scarcity. 

- To face the rising challenges and seize the opportunities, we must develop new institutional structures based on a commitment to the values of \it{Universal Access} and \it{Universal Design}. 

%% A little more about these institutions and what they will need to look like, etc. bridgeing the 'scale gap' and all that - need for focus of purpose and expansive impact 

- In this proposal, we present a potential model of an Open Source Ecosystem (OSE) as a prototype organization structured in service of these needs. 

- Specifically, we descripbe a plan to buttress and shape the burdgeoning community of users, developers, students, and educators forming around the FreeMoCap Project (FMC) into a self-sustaining and expansive Open Source Ecosystem (OSE). 
% - Current model not fit for present and future needs
% - Need alternative models, organizations, infrastructures for science and education

%   - Generative and self sustaining
%     - Von Neumann machine - Sustainibility through replicability
%   - As Autonomous As Possible (allow the fewest to do the most)
%   - Topic/software/hardware agnostic
%   - Multi-scale adaptable, extensible, maintainable, and replicable [SEP]
% - Two Loops theory of social progress

%   - Not saying we should burn it all to the ground
%     - It's already burning
%   - We need to build a better ship
%     - & f-ing ASAP plz thx

- Our plan comprises 3 inter-woven foci - 
- A core software platform and framework for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of human and animal movement (FMC-Core)
- A broad and diverse userbase representing wide array of backgrounds, interests, experience levels, and geographic sprea (FMC-Community)
- A self-sustaining organization to support a dedicated team of core maintainers who ensure the healthy growth and long-term stability of the ecosystem (FMC-Foundation)

\subsection{Intellectual Merit\label{sec:IM}}
% How we will advance knowledge 

- Enablabling tech-forward integrative research
- Rosetta Stones and Systems Engineers
- Training nextgen technowizards and cross-disciplinarians

\section{Broader Impacts\label{sec:BI}}
- **Meager success:**
  - New useful tool
  - New body of research realted to human/animation perceptuomotor control
  - Education tools and strategy
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - Support and sustain the growing community of `freemocap` users, loosely organized around a shared love of the measurement, investigation, analysis, and expression of human and animal movement (broadly construed) 
  - Sustainable organization and vibrant ecosystem existing as a proof-of-concept alternative organizational approach to broadscale academic research, education, and training
- **Idealist future:**
  - Iterative solutions on 'project-scale' strategy produces a vibrant **ecosystem of ecosystems** which fundamentally changes the face of education and scientific research.
