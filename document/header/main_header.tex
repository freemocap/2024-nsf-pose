% mandates, in Chapter 2, section B.2, that the main text should have a font size no less
% than 11 points for *most* typefaces (including Computer Modern Roman and Times (new) Roman).
% 
% Actually, Helvetica (a.k.a. Arial), Palatino and Courier New can drop
% to 10 point font size, according to the PAPPG, but be aware:
% 10-point fonts (whatever the typeface) will promote reader fatigue.
% Reader fatigue never works to the author's advantage.

% This sample  assumes the pdflatex chain (not the traditional latex | dvips | ps2pdf chain).
% It should function in the traditional chain if you comment out the hyperref package lines.
% 
%\usepackage{times} % uncomment for Times Roman;
%                   % replace "times" with other font names, as desired. 
\usepackage{bm} % If you want bold math, but without the bloat of AMS packages
\usepackage{color} % doh
\usepackage{hyperref} % LaTeX cross references become hyperlinks in pdf output
\usepackage{graphicx} % For figure insertion
%\usepackage{vmargin} % To set page size
\usepackage[letterpaper,margin=1in]{geometry}

% Hyperref stuff: WARNING: don't use \href{link}{clickable text} in the Project Description,
% as Resarch.gov doesn't like it. Likewise, avoid any text containing 
% http:, https:, mailto:, etc.

% Pseudodot: break up "clickable" strings like "Data.gov" which you can

% Use this trick in case research.gov misreads text such as "Data.gov" as a clickable hyperlink
% (even when it isn't).
