# 2024 FreeMoCap NSF POSE

## **Title**: *POSE: PHASE II: The Free Motion Capture (FreeMoCap) Project*

## Project Description

### The FreeMoCap Project

#### Specific Product/artifact(s)

- FreeMoCap Software
  - Poly-repo structure
  - Composed of various sub-skelly repos, each of which:
    - Can operate in a standalone format
    - Matches general architecture and CI/CD structure of parent `freemocap` software
- Federated datasets
  - e.g. Users able to 'donate' their data, while retaining ownership (earning divdends)
- Co-op ML/AI model(s)
  - Train our own CNN Tracker and LLM via 'Federated learning' scheme
  - Architecture allows any user to train/fine-tune the FMC Base Models using their private data, OPTIONALLY contribute updated model weights to the FMC-Org (e.g. see [`Flower`](https://flower.ai))
- Educational materials and documentation
  - Providing best-available educational materials, tutorials, and demos for related areas
    - Tech (e.g. Computer vision, Cameras, CNNs, etc)
    - Math (e.g. Linear algebra, timeseries analysis, computational geometry, kinematic/kinetic analysis)
    - Visualization (e.g. data visualization, animation, etc)
    - Science (e.g. human/animal movement, perception/action, etc )

#### Guiding Principles

##### Universal Design
- "When anyone can use it, everyone benefits"
- Same tool for 0XP as for professional
- "The [aspirational goal] of creating a system that serves the needs of a professional research scientist while remaining intuitive to a 13-year-old with no technical training and no outside assistance"
- **Maintain a True Minimum option**
  - Understand and maintain an option to run with the barest possible hardware
  - Focus and maintain a [generic hardware] pipeline as the core path
    - Using specific proprietary hardware (e.g. stereocams, kinect) can be developed as secondary routes and/or via a plugin system
    - Clients may request development of a proprietary pipeline, in exchange for funds to support it
- ** Sustainability through accessibility**
  - The key to sustainability is a growing, active, diverse, and vibrant userbase
  - Universal design attracts the widest possible userbase
  - Education focus:
    - to avoid [paradox of the active user]
    - foster long term user relationships
    - encourage community engagement 
      - Push user-student into 'zone of proximal development'
      - Provide easy access to resources (AI, static, community)
##### No artificial scarcity
  - "Knowledge is free, labor is unbelievable expensive"
  - Anything that can be duplicated infinitely is free for everyone
    - Software, documentation, tutorial/educational material, etc
  - Anything that is finite (or costs us money) can be charged
    - e.g. server side processing and cloud storage
    - Sliding scale pay options [HumbleBundleModel]
      - Recommended cost relative to break-even.
      - Give user option to allocate overage to different programs/departments
        - (by necessity, the recommendations will be followed if at all possible, adjustments may be made to ensure long term stability of the FMC-Org.
        - Its kinda like a voting system, but with money)
        - Support for:
          - New features
          - Specific projects
          - Scholarship/community grants program
          - Unspecified
      - Users requesting at-or-below cost must submit a request, which can be evaluated and supported via the 'communal support' scholarship/money bucket [CommunityGrantSystem]

#### Long-term vision

- Fully integrated FOSS platform for Laser Skeleton research/recording
  - Fully-body mocap
  - 3d Gaze
  - Integrated laser skeleton
  - Can also serve as a generic Computer Vision platform
- Global community of freemocap student/educators and user/developers
- Economically self-sustaining combination research/software development institute supporting:
  - Support and development for core software(s)
  - Research in related fields
    - Neuroscience (human and non-human)
      - Motor control (mocap)
      - Visual/oculomotor neuroscience (eye tracking)

#### Sustainability Goals
- Activities
- Metrics and monitoring
  - User base 
  - Community
  - Software performance

#### Broader impacts

##### Current Context
- Technical landscape
- Social landscape
- Need and Gap
- Current FreeMoCap OSE status

#### Expected Impact

- Lots, probably!
- Describe (short, middle, long) term (plans, potential futures, and resultant impacts)

### The FreeMoCap Foundation

- Organizational structure
  - Worker oriented structure (co-op of some kind)
    - e.g. one of these wacky things:
      - Haber, Michael, The New Activist Non-Profits: Four Models Breaking from the Non-Profit Industrial Complex (May 15, 2019). University of Miami Law Review, Vol. 73, 2019, Hofstra Univ. Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2019-07, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3388752
- Governance
  - 501c3 incorporation documents and bylaws for org
  - Explicitly crib from numpy or other big project for their gov/docs
- Community Engagement
- Transparency
- Finances (e.g. Backyard Brains 'open finances' model)

### Building the FMC OSE

#### Ecosystem establishment and growth plan

- Current community
- growth plans/metrics

#### Organizational governance structure

- FMC Org governance
  - Official 501c3 bylaws
  - Non-profit coop stuff (from the tiktok guy's references)
- FMC FOSS governance
  - explicitly crib from numpy, and other bigg'ns
- Licensing model
  - AGPLv3 for all repos owned by FMC-Foundation
  - Exclusive sub-licensing rights to SkellyTech
    - SkellyTech handles B2B license agreement, whereby we offer software using non-AGPLv3 license
      - Cost dependent on 'distance' from AGPLv3 (AGPL -> GPL -> LGPL -> Apache/MIT -> ... -> Proprietary)
    - Can offer sub-license agreement for existing software, or to create custom software solutions

#### Methods for evaluating OSE's effectiveness

- Community growth metrics
  - Raw numbers (more users is good)
  - Global distribution and spread should match popultion density
  - Individual user trajectories
    - Minimize 'bounce' (Single pings)
    - Maximize 'velocity' (`extracted user growth` non-stagnant, e.g. `anti-paradox-of-active-user` protocols)
- Software quality
  - Generic validation metrics should be strictly monotonically increasing
    - i.e. global measure of 'goodness' of mocap data should ALWAYS increase over time

#### Security and Privacy

- Fully offline local processing option
- Google Cloud Platform for secrets management
- Matrix homeserver for privacy, security, consistency
- Full instruction set on how to duplicate infrastructure with documentation and tutorials

#### Community Engagement

##### Annual Workshop: FreeMoCamp ðŸ’€â›º

- Inspirations:
  - Neuromatch (for virtual component)
  - Cold spring harbor (short term research project/workshop timeline)
  - Get an example of a hackathon from the Endurance crew
- In person & Virtual
  - Held at YMCA summer camp, or similar
    - All inclusive ticket - lodging and food handled by summer camp facilities
  - Online component via dedicated Element space (with Slack/Discord bridges)
  - ANYONE can view all online materials, and follow along activities (encouraging conversationin public server)
  - Paid online participants may engage directly in the dedicated event space, and will get direct engagement with folks at the in-person event (for troubleshooting/planning/etc)
  - Pricing
    - Corpo pricing ->  100% standard price (Set high enough to make the lowest pay tiers make sense)
    - Academic pricing -> 50% standard price
    - Community members (defined by badges and community participation) -> 25% Standard price
    - Additional **STEEP** discounts and scholarship programs for students, educators, researchers, artists, etc
      - Minimum price w/o scholarship = break-even price per participant
  - Combination hackathon, training workshop, and scientific conference on 'fully body movement research'
- Participants in teams
  - Plan and collect a data set
  - Analyze and present results
  - Encourage collaboration and data sharing between teams
  - Offer training/presentation 'tracks' for
    - Data collection
      - Understand and use the core software
    - Data analysis
      - Analyze and computationally model data
    - Data visualization (and animation/art)
      - Create visualizations and animations from freemocap data

##### Community Challenges

- Offer a prompt for a kind of movement/activity to record
  - Community works to record the best entry, submitted via Discord/Element/Freemocap.org
    - Community votes in 'Eurovision style'
      - i.e. each member has a fixed number of voting points to distribute among entries
      - Maybe **Badges** provide additional voting points?

##### Gamified documentation/software training

- Offer **Badges** and stuff in discord for milestones, i.e.
  - First contact - open the software
  - First record - Anything recorded
  - First success - Successful recording
  - e.g. also calibration, data analysis, PR, etc
- Apply badges in Discord/Element server (associated with a `freemocap.org` account?)
  - Badges offer ability to send 'top level' messages to otherwise view-only channels (i.e technical spaces)
    - Anyone can create a **thread** from a top-level message though
    - The idea would be to create spaces where higher XP folk can talk about complicated stuff without distraction [WorkingInPublic]
    - But also LowerXP folk can still see the conversations and ask questions (Maybe make it easy to summon SkellyBot to explain a message/conversation ðŸ¤”)

    - Maintain accurate assessmenet of minimum, recommended, and maximum hardware requirements
    - Use to build an automatic runtime resource manager which provides recommended settings for the system it is running on 
      - This is an accessibilty thing, since we want to be able to clearly understand the TRUE MINIMUM requirements
- Automated release/versioning on commit to `main`
- Poly-repo format
  - Sub-skelly repos mimic structure of core `freemocap` software
    - Standalone GUI/CLI
