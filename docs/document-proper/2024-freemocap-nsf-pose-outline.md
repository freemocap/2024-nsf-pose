# 2024 FreeMoCap NSF POSE 

## **Title**: *POSE: PHASE II: The Free Motion Capture (FreeMoCap) Project*

## Project Description 

### The FreeMoCap Open Source Ecosystem (FMC OSE)
   - Specific Product
      - FreeMoCap Software
      - Federated dataset 
      - Co-op model
   - Long-term vision 
   - Guiding Principles
   - Current Context
   - Potential impact

### Building the FMC OSE
#### Ecosystem establishment and growth plan
  - Current community
  - growth plans/metrics
#### Organizational governance structure
  - FMC Org governance
    - Official 501c3 bylaws 
    - Non-profit coop stuff (from the tiktok guy's references)
  - FMC FOSS governance
    - explicitly crib from numpy, and other bigg'ns
#### Methods for evaluating OSE's effectiveness
  - Community growth metrics
    - Raw numbers (more users is good)
    - Global distribution and spread should match popultion density
    - Individual user trajectories
      - Minimize 'bounce' (Single pings)
      - Maximize 'velocity' (`extracted user growth` non-stagnant, e.g. anti-paradox-of-active-user protocols)
  - Software quality
    - Generic validation metrics should be strictly monotonically increasing
      - i.e. global measure of 'goodness' of mocap data should ALWAYS increase over time
