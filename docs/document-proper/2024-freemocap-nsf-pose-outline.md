## Long Term Vision for
Describe the Ideal Perfect Future vision of... 

### The FreeMoCap Project
  - Technical Capacities 
  - Infrastructure
  - Tools and Frameworks
  - Documentation and covert education
  
### The FreeMoCap Community
  - Broad and deep user base, integrating:
    - User/Developers
    - Scientist/Artists
    - Student/Expert
  - Active social community space where users can share progress and ask questions

### The FreeMoCap Foundation 
  - 501c3
  - Indpendently support FreeMoCap Project/Community
  - Handle security, privacy of data, codebase,  and user info
  - Paying a core set of maintainer/developers
  - Revenue streams
    - For Profit sub-entitie(s) 
      - `Skellytech`
        - B2B connections and sub-licensing of:
          - Core-software 
          - Derivative models (co-op data ownership)
        - Any arrangement that does not fall under the 'charitable activities' allowed by 501c3 guidelines
      - Spin-off companies (FreeMoCap as tech incubator)
        - Incubator support for FMCF member/students who want to start businesses or organizations based on freemocap related technology and tools
        - Offer umbrella support (we support them with our org infrastructure, e.g. grant support), or
        - Launchpad support (pathway to independence)
        - Offer exit (any time) and re-entry (if possoible) mechanisms
    - Manage grants, both for org (e.g. NSF POSE) and individual research grants for members of FMCF (e.g. R01's and F32's)
    - Selling hardware/cameras
      - first, dropship standard cameras and packages (low-to-high quality)
      - later, develop custom cameras (including education focused cameras)
    - Donation drives 
    - Clients (Contracting from FMC community)
      - Custom code/software
      - Project planning and consultation 
      - Technical support
      - Direct teaching/training
    - Annual Workshop (FreeMoCamp)
    - Annual Conference (FreeMoCon)
    - Server-side processing
    - Cloud data storage
