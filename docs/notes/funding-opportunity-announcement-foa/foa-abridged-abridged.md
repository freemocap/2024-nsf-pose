# Project Description

- An Open Source Ecosystem (OSE) consists of:

  - leadership team
  - managing organization with
    - well-defined **governance** structure
    - **distributed development** model
    - cohesive community of external content developers
    - broad base of users across academia, industry, govt
- Proposed OSE

  - Specific Product/(Living) Artifact
  - Long-term vision
  - Guiding Principles
  - Current context
    - Demand for Product within current technological landscape
  - Potential Impact
- Plan for building an OSE including:

  - ecosystem establishment/growth
  - organzational governance structure
  - Adaptable and flexible framework for continuous:
    - Development
    - Integration
    - Deployment
  - methods for evaluating OSE's effectiveness
  - activities to ensure **security** and **privacy**
  - actvities to build the community of Intellectual Content Creators
    - Users
    - Developers
    - User/Developers
  - activities to sustain the ecosystem
  - 
  - OS Community building:
    - recruitment
    - motivation
    - mentoring
    - managing
    - mediating disputes

### **A fully developed OSE is based on:**

1. A robust open-source artifact,
2. managed by an organization that:
3. coordinates an external distributed developer community;
4. interfaces with and supports a community of users;
5. provides training and onboarding to new developers and users;
6. enables efficient continuous development,integration and deployment of the open-source product;
7. maintains an efficient supply chain;
8. ensures security, privacy and reliability of all aspects of the OSE operation
9. maintains appropriate organizational governance practices.

### `from Artifact to Ecosystem`:

- Product
- Governance
- Documentation
- Scientist (core maintainers)
- Onboarding
- Developer community
- External Users
- Distributed Development
- Defect management (bug fixing)
- Security/Privacy

### Pose funding to CATALYZE:

- Managing organization
- Content/Product development
- Developer onboarding
- Testing and evaluation
- Security and Privacy
- Sustainability
- End-user discovery and outreach

### Ecosystem Discovery:

#### Scoping and Planning (phase 1)

Include a plan for developing a strategy that:

1. describes methods to **evaluate and justify the need** for the innovation within the current technological landscape;
2. explains **why an OSE** is the right approach to further develop the technology; and
3. outlines methods to **identify potential users** who will utilize this technology

### Organization and Governance:

Describe specific activities and their rationale that will identify:

1. the appropriate:
   1. organizational,
   2. coordination,
   3. governance models
   4. licensing approach
2. the specific continuous development and integration processes and infrastructure that is most suitable for **open**, **asynchronous**, and **distributed development** of the open-source product,
3. processes for ensuring:
   1. quality,
   2. security,
   3. privacy or
   4. ethical concerns of new content
4. the best methods for sustaining the organizational structure, including:
   1. metrics to assess and evaluate long-term success of the development methodology,
   2. support for users,
   3. on-boarding mechanisms for new contributors/developers.

### Continuous Integration and Development

Describe the specific **continuous** **development**, **integration**, and **deployment** methodology and infrastructure that will be employed to enable the **open**, **asynchronous**, and **distributed development** of the open-source product and specific processes for ensuring:

- quality control,
- security
- privacy of new content.

### Community Building:

#### Scoping (Phase 1 - we should have already done )

Describe the specific activities to engage potential users and intellectual content developers, including:

1. identification of the specific research and development capabilities required of the potential contributor communities; and
2. mechanisms to engage these communities, e.g.:
   1. workshops,
   2. hackathons,
   3. competitions,
   4. research coordination networks,
   5. Ideas Labs.

### Establishment and growth

Describe a **long-term strategy** for community building to **engage**, **incentivize**, **on-board**, and **support** potential users and content developers who will help in further developing and maintaining the open-source product

### Sustainability

Articulate clear:

- **sustainability** goals of the OSE
- **actionable evaluation plan**
- **metrics to assess and evaluate success*

### **"Context of OSE"**

- A description of the **guiding principles**
- **Long-term vision** for the proposed OSE,
- The **specific societal or national need(s)** that the OSE will address, and
- Anticipated broader impacts of the OSE.
