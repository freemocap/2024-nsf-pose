  ### 1. (PROGRAM) INTRODUCTION
  - an  OSE is a **self-sustaining** organization that enables the...
    - ongoing
    - distributed
    - asynchronous...
  - ...development  of an OS product
  - OSE Key components:
    - leadership team responsible for:
      - governance
      - management
    - **intellectual content developers**
      - a **decentralized** and **open** network devs
      - who are committed to the **vision** of the OSE and contribute their time and XP to develop and maintain the core product
    - **users** who's needs guide the evolution of the project
  - OS Community building depends on elements like: 
    - recruitment
    - motivation
    - mentoring
    - managing
    - mediating disputes
    - 
> "OSE's are an important alternative to more common for-profit technology companies and offer several key   strengths: they are well suited to multidisciplinary efforts aimed at solving large-scale problems; they  engender a sense of ownership among all participants and encourage contributions from new technical disciplines as the OSE evolves; and they avoid costs, delays, and disputes that frequently arise in  circumstances where proprietary solutions are developed. OSEs encourage rapid prototyping in moving value  from the conception to execution phases, serving as important catalysts for innovation.""

### 2. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
- Key attribute of OSEs is a **distributed development model** in which **external intellectual content developers**  use:
  - Continuous (a) devlopment, (b) integration, and (c) deployment model
  - "Projects lacking this **distributed development aspect** are not well suited to POSE"
  - POSE IS **NOT** FOR - 
    - open-source development
    - robustness efforts
    - focused communitid with limited impact
    - NEGATIVE EXAMPLES 
      - "open-source software specific to the advanced cyberinfrastructure of a particular scientific community may be better served as a submission to the "Transition to Sustainability" track in the [NSF CSSI program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific)"
      - "for profit stuff is better for SBIR/STTR"
  - POSE **IS** FOR
    - building on exising, robust, open-source product that has **active users** outside of the founding team
## Figure 1

- **The transition from open-source research or innovation project to an OSE requires an organized and intentional approach that depends on many factors:**
    1. The **guiding principles** and **vision** of the founding team, 
    2. The specific open-source **product** being developed, 
    3. The **demand** for this product withinthe current technological landscape, 
    4. The need for adaptability and flexibility in **deployment** scenarios, 
    5. a **distributed** community of **intellectual content developers** who will drive the **collaborative** development of the technology, and 
    6. a community of users who will serve as **early adopters** of the technology.
  
 - OSEs are frequently supported by an **international** community of users and developers from **different sector**s, including:
   -  academia (researchers/scientists),
   -  non-profit (hospitals, education), and 
   -  industry (animation, video games, sports, robots, etc)
   
**A fully developed OSE is based on:**
1. A robust open-source artifact, 
2. managed by an organization that: 
   1. coordinates an external distributed developer community;
   2. interfaces with and supports a community of users; 
   3. provides training and onboarding to new developers and users;
   4. enables efficient continuous development,integration and deployment of the open-source product; 
   5. maintains an efficient supply chain; 
   6. ensures security, privacy and reliability of all aspects of the OSE operation
   7. maintains appropriate organizational governance practices.
   

**This solicitation seeks two types of proposals:** 
1. to scope and plan for an OSE (Phase I) [NOT US], and 
2. to establish and expand (Phase II) a sustainable OSE based on: 
   1. an existing and robust open-source product that...
   2. shows promise both in the ability to meet an emergent **societal** or **national** need and,
   3. to build a community to help develop it. 
3. Importantly, the open-source product should already: 
   1. be publicly accessible, preferably via an open-source license (proposers are encouraged to consider licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative) and
   2.  have some **external third-party users** and/or **external intellectual content developers**. 
  
**In this context the term "external" means external to the founding team**

## Figure 2
![alt text](image-1.png)

**An OSE supported by POSE, as shown in Figure 2, will comprise three components:** 
1. a distributed community of intellectual content developers from academia, industry and/or the non-profit sector; 
2. a community of third-party end users in research, industry, government, and/or other sectors â€“ some of whom may also be intellectual content developers; 
3. and a managing organization. 

**POSE funding will support the managing organization,** the role of which includes all of the
functions described above and whose overarching objective is to ensure **sustainability** of the OSE. 

> The primary distinction between Phase I and Phase II is that Phase I scoping and planning projects are intended for organizations that are less experienced or knowledgeable in building a distributed intellectual content developer or end user communities, and/or would benefit from learning more about the non-technical roles of a POSE managing organization â€“ e.g., **corporate governance**, **legal** and **administrative** functions, **licensing**, etc.


**Mandatory OSE training** - Training will: 
- enable each awarded team to determine whether there is the potential for a relevant and sustainable OSE for their open-source product,
-  learn best-practices for building a:
   -   secure, 
   -   private, and 
   -   sustainable OSE, and
-    identify broad societal impacts for their OSE. 
-   The program will include experiential learning activities in :
    -   ecosystem discovery
    -   community building, 
    -   governance, and s
    -   sustainability of OSEs.
